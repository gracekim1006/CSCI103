Answer to Questions: 
To find the point of diminishing returns, we must first define after what 
decimal place does the change become irrelevant. In my opinion, accuracy is
only relavent in this scenario to the hundreth's decimal place. Therfore, 
after 100,000 simulations we will reach a point in which the hundreth's 
decimal point will stabalize. Thus, after a hundred thousand trials, we
have reached our point of diminishing returns.
