When we have a number of variable length, the process to extract each digit
and it's place is a little tricky. The method in which I did it was based
on a pattern. To extract each digit in ascending order, you divided by 10
to a certain power (depending on which digit) then mod by 10 to get the
digit you want. 
Example: 
# = 15673
To get the one's digit, you divide by 10^0 and mod by 10. 
   (15673 / 10^0) % 10 = 3. 
To get the ten's digit, you divide by 10^1 and mod by 10. 
   (15673 / 10^1) % 10 = 7.
Everytime the power of 10 increase by one you are eliminating the digit 
preceding it. 
Thus, a while loops works perfectly because once the power of 10 becomes 
higher than the number you inputted, you will know that you are done
extracting digits. This is the condition for the while loop.
