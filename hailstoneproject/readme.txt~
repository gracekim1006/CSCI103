================================ Questions ==================================

1. Which kind of a loop did you use for the first program? Why?

:

2a. Once you've completed the second program, run hailstats on the following
inputs, and record your results in the table below:

  input range  | minimum length | achieved by | maximum length | achieved by
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    50 100     |6               |64           |118             |97             
   100 200     |7               |128          |124             |171            
   200 400     |8               |256          |143             |327           

2b. What pattern do you think there is in the values achieving minimum length?
Can you explain why it holds?

:The pattern in achieving minimum length is they are all achieved by powers
of 2. This holds because when the number starts off even and a power of 2,
it will keep dividing by 2 until it reaches one. It will never reach an 
odd number that is not one, requiring the program to multiply by three and
add one.Thus, powers of 2 have the most streamlined path towards one.

3a. Let X be the smallest integer whose length is greater than 150.
By running your hailstats program several times on carefully chosen inputs,
determine what is the value of X.

X is :

3b. Explain, briefly, the way in which you used your hailstats program
(i.e., which inputs you gave it) to find this answer.
