=============================== Prelab ==================================


1.I used a 2d boolean array. 

2.You mark a cell as visited when it is a valid neighbor of the current
location your own.

=============================== Review ==================================

1. It did behave as expected, for the program found the shortest path despite 
the fact that there were multiple ways to get to the finish. In theory, when 
the BFS got to the 4th layer it found the solution and kept that. As a result,
it is the shortest solution because a longer solution would only be found in a
following layer. 

============================== Remarks ==================================

Filling in anything here is OPTIONAL.
